## Usage

1. Start ComfyUI with Civicomfy installed
2. Access the Civicomfy panel from the Civicomfy menu button at the right top area.
3. Search for models
4. Click the download button on any model to save it to your local installation
5. Models become immediately available in ComfyUI nodes

## Configuration

- Enter your Civitai API Token in the settings, or set `CIVITAI_API_KEY` in the server environment (useful for cloud deployments like RunPod).
- Choose the Civitai domain used by search, previews, downloads, and result links: `civitai.com` or `civitai.red`.
- Optional: enable searching the opposite domain when the selected domain returns no search results.
- Optional: enable searching the opposite domain when the selected domain returns an error.
- The Civicomfy panel uses a dark blue theme for `civitai.com` and a dark red theme for `civitai.red`.
- Optional: set a custom download path using variables: `{model_name}`, `{base_model}`, `{model_category}`, and `{model_type}`.
  - Example: `{model_type}/{base_model}/{model_name}`.
- Optional: set a **Global Download Root** in Civicomfy settings.
  - When set, Civicomfy saves to `<global_root>/<model_type>` (for example `/runpod-volume/ComfyUI/checkpoints` or `/runpod-volume/ComfyUI/loras`).
  - When empty, Civicomfy uses the default ComfyUI paths (`folder_paths` / `extra_model_paths.yaml`).
  - The global root is persisted on disk in `custom_nodes/Civicomfy/root_settings.json`.
